### About Me

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a research paper to compare our methods of finding quasi-separatrix layers with the methods of another author. 

ðŸŒ± I'm learning better git practice, Java and Puppet. I've recently started looking at Lua too, and have been playing around with Python's BeautifulSoup package.
